# Writing Pseudocode based on Overview of the Project list provided on 3.3.2 
#
# 0. Start by getting data files we need 
# 1. Calculate total number of votes cast
# 2. Compile a list of all candidates who received votes
# 3. Calculate total number of votes each candidate received
# 4. Calculate percentage of votes each candidate won
# 5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote
# 
# from 3.3.3 instructions to write pseudocode to create a model/flowchart/roadmap for your code to be executed
# 
# This is the idea from the module

# 1. Open the data file.
# 2. Write down the names of all the candidates.
# 3. Add a vote count for each candidate.
# 4. Get the total votes for each candidate.
# 5. Get the total votes cast for the election.
