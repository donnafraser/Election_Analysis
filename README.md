# Election_Analysis

This is just getting submitted to meet deadline and to allow me to move on to next Module. If I don't start the next one, I will certainly fall behind and lose hope.
Sorry that this is not anything it is supposed to be. It it makes a difference, I have spent over 25+ hours just working, getting stuck, and solving one tiny issue to encounter more, I am literally stuck in a loop just searching for the "correct anser" so I can proceed on to the next problem.....so far, no luck. Infinite loop....

It started like this......and just got worse........
Start of Module 3 work
Hope I cloned my GitHub repository correctly. Going to search desktop for it now.....dang OneDrive!

Ended up with multiple files in different directories, 2 VS Code areas to work in...? Neither containing all files downloaded. 
Been pretty confused and stuck just sorting out details on where I am supposed to be working, is work getting saved, where did it go?
Why are files downloading here, but I'm doing all my work in a different folder. 

Trying not to give up. Have reached out to Student Engagement, and Student Success Manager for assistance and guidance on who can help me sort through the web of confusion that has set in for why things aren't working as described in my material. 

Fingers crossed. Will submit this again once I can figure out what is going so horribly wrong. Toes crossed, too!
