# Election_Analysis
Start of Module 3 work
Hope I cloned my GitHub repository correctly. Going to search desktop for it now.....dang OneDrive!

Ended up with multiple files in different directories, 2 VS Code areas to work in...? Neither containing all files downloaded. 
Been pretty confused and stuck just sorting out details on where I am supposed to be working, is work getting saved, where did it go?
Why are files downloading here, but I'm doing all my work in a different folder. 

Trying not to give up. Have reached out to Student Engagement, and Student Success Manager for assistance and guidance on who can help me sort through the web of confusion that has set in for why things aren't working as described in my material. 

Fingers crossed. Will submit this again once I can figure out what is going so horribly wrong. Toes crossed, too!
